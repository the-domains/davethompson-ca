  Dave Thompson began guitar at age 13 with lessons at a local music store.
  Guitar quickly became an obsession over that next summer, and Dave began
  playing in garage bands, high-school combos. Along with hours of self-study,
  Dave took lessons with Bob McFee (jazz) and Tibor Puskas (classical).
  Eventually Dave learned harmony and arranging from Jim Howard, and that
  experience led to studying with Herb Pomeroy and Ken Pullig at the Berklee
  College of Music in Boston where he graduated with a B. Mus. in Jazz
  Composition.

Dave Thompson began guitar at age 13 with lessons at a local music store. Guitar quickly became an obsession over that next summer, and Dave began playing in garage bands, high-school combos. Along with hours of self-study, Dave took lessons with Bob McFee (jazz) and Tibor Puskas (classical). Eventually Dave learned harmony and arranging from Jim Howard, and that experience led to studying with Herb Pomeroy and Ken Pullig at the Berklee College of Music in Boston where he graduated with a B. Mus. in Jazz Composition. 

Over the years Dave has worked in all sorts of venues: concert halls, festivals, summer resorts, clubs, musical theatre, radio and TV, as well as on many CDs as a sideman, producer or arranger. Recent work includes tours with Juno-winners Kellylee Evans (with whom Dave was thrilled to open for George Benson, Richard Bona, and Chris Botti) and Susan Aglukark, and as a sideman and bandleader with various artists (including the local Waterloo Jazz Room and Registry Theatre).

He has performed several shows over many years with Drayton Entertainment and has played guitars, mandolin and banjo for the Stratford Festival in productions such as "Tommy", "Wanderlust" and "Jesus Christ Superstar". He is an adjunct professor at Heritage College in Cambridge teaching music business, performance and recording arts. Over his studio career he has played, engineered, produced and arranged for many clients as well as on his own releases, including the 2007 vocal jazz-pop CD "found. Wanting."
