            <description><![CDATA[<p>Dave Thompson began guitar at age 13 with lessons at a local music store. Guitar quickly became an obsession over that next summer, and Dave began playing in garage bands, high-school combos. Along with hours of self-study, Dave took lessons with Bob McFee (jazz) and Tibor Puskas (classical). Eventually Dave learned harmony and arranging from Jim Howard, and that experience led to studying with Herb Pomeroy and Ken Pullig at the Berklee College of Music in Boston where he graduated with a B. Mus. in Jazz Composition.</p>]]></description>
